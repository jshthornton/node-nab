Node Nab
========

It has gotten to the point where I am fed up of having to manually find every elemennt I need in a set of html (I'm looking at you templates), then assigning it to a variable in a view object. This gets even worse when your web designer changes a class name you were hooked to!

Node Nab aims to eliminate this issue for you. By simply importing node nab you will be able to automatically assign elements to a named variable.
